-current measurement: data rounded too much? (curves with steps plotted).
-missing views:
  BNC555
  PH_Sixpack
  SRDG535
  PH_PPPA_PowerUnit
  PH_PPMA_PowerUnit
-fix class PH_MercuryMonitor: fix device status icon in detailed view, check display of concentration unit in plot label
-sort subsystems/classtypes (maybe instances as well)
-add customization possibility for shot index view
